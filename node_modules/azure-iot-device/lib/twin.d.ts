/**
 * A Device Twin is document describing the state of a device that is stored by an Azure IoT hub and is available even if the device is offline.
 * It is built around 3 sections:
 *   - Tags: key/value pairs only accessible from the service side
 *   - Desired Properties: updated by a service and received by the device
 *   - Reported Properties: updated by the device and received by the service.
 *
 * Note that although it is a possibility, desired and reported properties do not have to match
 * and that the logic to sync these two collections, if necessary, is left to the user of the SDK.
 *
 * For more information see {@link https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins|Understanding Device Twins}.
